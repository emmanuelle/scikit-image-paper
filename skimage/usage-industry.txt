scikit-image is well suited for industrial applications due to the 
breadth and maturity of its code base, and its use of the 
commercial-friendly BSD license. 

BT Imaging [BTImaging]_ designs and builds tools that use photoluminescence (PL) 
imaging for photovoltaic applications. PL imaging can characterize 
the quality of multicrystalline silicon wafers by illuminating defects 
that are not visible under standard viewing conditions. Figure :ref:`PL1` shows an optical image of a 
silicon wafer, and Figure :ref:`PL2` shows the same wafer using PL imaging. 
Figure :ref:`PL3` shows the wafer defects and impurities found through automated 
image analysis. scikit-image plays a key role in the image processing
pipeline. For example, a Hough transform (``transform.hough_line``) finds the wafer edges
in order to segment the wafer from the background. scikit-image
is also used for feature extraction. It is important to locate grain boundaries 
(the interface between small crystals) and differentiate them from other defects.
Grain boundaries are found by applying a thinning algorithm (``morphology.skeletonize``) 
to the results of edge detection (``filter.sobel``) for the optical image.

[emma: if we need to save some space, I'm not sure that Fig. :ref:`PL1`
is needed; what's most interesting is the comparison between Figure
:ref:`PL2` and Figure :ref:`PL3`]

The image processing results are input to machine learning
algorithms, which assess intrinsic wafer quality. Solar cell manufacturers
can use this information to reject poor quality wafers and charge more 
for cells that are expected to have high efficiency.

   A PL image of the wafer from Figure :ref:`PL1`. Wafer defects, which have a negative impact 
   solar cell efficiency, are visible as dark regions. :label:`PL2`

   Image processing results. Defects in the crystal growth (dislocations) 
   are colored blue, while red indicates the presence of impurities. :label:`PL3`
   

scikit-image is also being used in a commercial setting for biometric security applications. 
AICBT Ltd uses multispectral imaging to detect when a person 
is attempting to conceal their identity using a mask [AICBT]_. 
scikit-image performs file I/O (``io.imread``), histogram equalization
(``exposure.equalize_hist``), and aligns the visible wavelength image with
the thermal image (``transform.AffineTransform``). The system determines
the surface temperature of a subject's skin and detects situations where the
face is being obscured.
